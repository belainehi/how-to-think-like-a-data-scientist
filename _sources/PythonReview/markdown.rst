Markdown Cells
==============

There are two types of cells in Notebooks: code cells and text cells. One of the differences
between the two types of cells is their variety. While code cells will vary in their format
based on the programming language used, the text cells will always use a universally recognized
text format language known as Markdown.

Markdown is a lightweight Markup (human-readable syntax) language that many consider being a
key authoring framework for data science. Markdown allows for capabilities like bolding, italicizing,
or making headers similar to word processing tools like Google Docs or Microsoft Word.

In Notebook, Markdown Cells are run in the same way as Code Cells by pressing on the Run button or holding
the Shift + Return keys. Outside of Notebooks, you can use Markdown to create a web page, pdf,
MS Word document, slide show, and a whole host of other file types.

section. To learn more about Google Collab, a similar cloud-based Notebook that
will not require any installations on your computer, see the Colab section.
